    I have experience with Software Development, Machine Learning, and Data 
    Science, and tools such as Python, Java, and R. I am studying for a 
    Mathematics MSc at St Andrews and graduating in 2020.

    I am currently looking for opportunities where I can add value and continue 
    to expand my skill set.
