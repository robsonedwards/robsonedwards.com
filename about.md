I'm passionate about creating elegant software systems using the latest 
technologies. I have experience with concepts like Machine Learning, Data 
Science, Statistics, and tools like python, pandas, R, and more. 
I graduated from St Andrews with a BSc (Hons) Mathematics in 2019 and I am 
a Software Engineer intern at JP Morgan in Glasgow this summer. 

I am currently looking for opportunities in Fall 2019 and beyond where I 
can add value and continue to expand my skill set.
